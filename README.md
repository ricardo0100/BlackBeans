### Architecture

#### MVVM
Every module follows the **MVVM** pattern with one or more Views, and one ViewModel.

#### Dependency Injection

The `ViewModel` should receive its dependencies in the `init()`. This allows `ViewModel` unit tests.
The injection should be done in the `View` that owns the `ViewModel`, where the available dependecies should be available using the `@EnvironmentObject` property wrapper.
This is necessary to use SwiftUI's `@FetchedRequest`.

#### Example


=======
- Effectivation date for Items
- Categories for Items
